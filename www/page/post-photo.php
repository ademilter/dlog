            <h1>Jedi Principles of UI Animation</h1>

            <h4>
                I like sci-fi movies. A problem with sci-fi movies is that they happen in a vast fictional universe that
                I have no idea about. There’s a ton of stuff going on and only two hours of screen time to get me up to
                speed.
            </h4>

            <p>
                I used be a print designer, then web designer, then UI designer. Now I’m becoming a UX
                choreographer — great title to put on a resume. So here’s how that happened: I can’t code. What that
                really means is I can’t make my designs come to life. I’ve spent hours and hours explaining what happens
                when you push that button. I needed a better way to explain how interactions work, so I decided to start
                animating.

                Always think about the perceived user experience instead of abstract “number of clicks”. Rachel Nabors
                from Salesforce tweeted an example of abstract “total load time” versus actual perceived time by users.
                For example, shake animation on incorrect password entry seems to take more time than instantly
                displaying a small error badge. In reality, a user might spend a couple seconds trying to locate error
                message to find out what went wrong, instead of noticing the animation and instantly understanding the
                action.

                    Imagine you’re editing an action scene in a movie; say, the duel between Luke and Darth Vader.
                    Define the overall tempo of your action scene first: is it fast or slow? Then, prioritize individual
                    motions: the most spectacular or important motions (like chopping a hand with a lightsaber) should
                    last longer while secondary motions should be shorter and overlap.
